# Challenge: Welcome to Java!
Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.

The code stubs in your editor declare a Solution class and a main method. Complete the main method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of your main method.

``` java
System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
```

Input Format
There is no input for this challenge.

Output Format
You must print two lines of output:

``` java
Print Hello, World. on the first line.
Print Hello, Java. on the second line.
```
Sample Output
Hello, World.
Hello, Java.

# Answer:
``` java
public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World.");
        System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
        
    }
}
``` 

## Explanation:

The challenge is an introductory exercise in Java designed to familiarize you with basic syntax and the process of printing output to the console using `System.out.println()` statements. The task requires that you print two specific lines of text.


#### 1. `public class Solution {`
   - **Explanation**: This line declares a class named `Solution`. In Java, all code must be inside a class. The `public` keyword makes the class accessible from outside its package. This is standard practice for the main class in an application.
   - **Relevance**: The class name `Solution` is often used in coding challenges. However, in a real-world application, the class name should reflect the functionality of the class.

#### 2. `public static void main(String[] args) {`
   - **Explanation**: This line declares the `main` method, which is the entry point of any Java application.
     - `public`: The `main` method must be public so that it is accessible when the program starts.
     - `static`: This allows the Java runtime to call the `main` method without needing to instantiate the class.
     - `void`: This indicates that the method does not return any value.
     - `String[] args`: This parameter is an array of `String` arguments passed from the command line. While not used in this program, it is often used to pass configuration or command-line arguments.
   - **Relevance**: The `main` method is the first method that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) invokes, which is why it must always be defined exactly in this way for the program to run.

#### 3. `System.out.println("Hello, World.");`
   - **Explanation**: This line outputs the text `"Hello, World."` to the console.
     - `System`: A class that provides access to system-level resources.
     - `out`: A static field within `System`, which represents the standard output stream (typically the console).
     - `println`: A method of `out` that prints the given text followed by a new line.
   - **Relevance**: This line fulfills the first part of the challenge requirement by printing `"Hello, World."` on the console.

#### 4. `System.out.println("Hello, Java.");`
   - **Explanation**: Similar to the previous line, this statement prints `"Hello, Java."` to the console and then moves to the next line.
   - **Relevance**: This line satisfies the second requirement by printing `"Hello, Java."` on the next line.

### Summary of Execution:
When the program runs, it will print:
```
Hello, World.
Hello, Java.
```
Each `System.out.println()` command outputs its text and moves the cursor to a new line, ensuring the two phrases are on separate lines as required by the challenge.

## Data Analysis of the Result:

Since this challenge only involves printing static text, there isn’t much to analyze in terms of data. However, the success criteria are simple:
- **Correctness**: The program should print exactly what is specified.
  - Output `Hello, World.` on the first line.
  - Output `Hello, Java.` on the second line.

The program's output matches the sample output exactly, meaning it meets the criteria for correctness. The program demonstrates the correct use of basic syntax and standard output in Java, which is essential for writing even the simplest Java applications.

### Comment:
This is a very basic program that serves as a gentle introduction to Java programming. By completing this challenge, you learn:
- How to define a class and a `main` method in Java.
- How to print output to the console using `System.out.println()`.

Understanding these basic concepts is foundational before moving on to more complex topics like data types, variables, and control structures.

## Further or Alternative Analysis:

Although this example is very simple, there are ways to extend this task to build upon fundamental Java concepts. Here are some alternative analyses or extensions:

1. **Using `System.out.print()` Instead of `System.out.println()`**:
   - An alternative way to print the messages would involve using `System.out.print()`, which does not add a newline character after the output. For example:
     ```java
     System.out.print("Hello, World.\n");
     System.out.print("Hello, Java.\n");
     ```
   - This approach manually adds `\n` (the newline character) to achieve the same result. While this adds complexity in such a simple program, it demonstrates how line control works in Java.

2. **String Formatting**:
   - This task could be extended to demonstrate string formatting with `System.out.printf()`:
     ```java
     System.out.printf("%s%n%s%n", "Hello, World.", "Hello, Java.");
     ```
   - Here, `%s` is a placeholder for a string, and `%n` is a platform-independent newline character. Using `printf()` is useful when dealing with formatted text or when you want to control output precisely.

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
   - While not directly applicable here due to the lack of input, exploring error handling (using `try-catch` blocks) can be introduced in a future exercise where input/output could fail (e.g., file operations or user input).

Overall, these extensions would provide a broader understanding of Java’s output capabilities and add flexibility in handling different output scenarios in more complex programs.
